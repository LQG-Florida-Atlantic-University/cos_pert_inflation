Manifestly Gauge-Invariant Cosmological Perturbation Theory from Full Loop Quantum Gravity II: Inclusion of Inflaton.

- eom_and_continuum_limit.nb contains the equations of motion (EoMs) of cosmological perturbation with inflaton up to first order. The continuum limit is calculated.
- newH0novnewschemefsimpccdN2.zip contains the simplied jacobian matrix (20-by-20) of first order linear ODE of perturbation. The detailed information can be found in eom_and_continuum_limit.nb and the paper.
- cosmo_pert.jl contains the numerical evaluation of background and perturbations. It is recommended to use [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) to read and evaluate the file.
